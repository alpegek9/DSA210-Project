# DSA210-Project


# Introduction
The aim of this project is to analyze the chess games that i played on chess.com since 01/01/2024 which is exactly 2338.I have a grand total of 12829 games so in order to be practical i chose a specific timeline.

# Hypothesis
My win rate is higher or equal to %50 and i have higher win rate when playing white.

# Motivation
I chose to focus on this project for two reasons, mainly because chess has been a passion for me since 2019 and secondly because im actually curious of all the findings and how it may affect my future games that i may find during the analisis of the data.

# Data Source
I downloaded the data from chess.com games archive.It has the event,site,date,round,white and black players username,result,white and black elo,timecontrol,endtime and termination as recorded data. I'll be focusing on date,result and termination.Result shows which side won and termination reveals who won by which method.Also I'll hide my opponents names since i cannot get the consent of all of them.

# Project Plan
I'll convert the pgn files to txt.
