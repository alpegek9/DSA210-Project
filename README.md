# DSA210-Project


The aim of this project is to analyze chess games that i played on chess.com since 01/01/2024 which is exactly 2338.I have a grand total of 12829 games so in order to be practical i chose a specific timeline. I chose to focus on this project for two reasons, mainly because chess has been a passion for me since 2019 and secondly because im actually curious of all the findings and how it may affect my future games that i may find during the analisis of the data.I downloaded the data from chess.com games archive.I plan to extract the dataframe using Pandas and before extraction im planing on merging all the data into a single .txt file so it can be easier for me to do it. Also I'll hide my opponents names since i cannot get the consent of all of them.
